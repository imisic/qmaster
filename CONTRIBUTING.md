# Contributing to Quartermaster

Thanks for your interest in improving Quartermaster!

## Background

This project was built by a non-developer (product/telecom person) using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). It works for my setup - WSL with PHP/Python projects and MySQL databases - but I can't promise it handles every edge case perfectly.

## ⚠️ Important: Code Contributions Not Accepted

**This tool handles sensitive data** - database passwords, backup files, system credentials. For security reasons, I'm **not accepting pull requests with code changes** at this time.

Since I'm not a developer, I can't properly review code for security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior. A compromised backup tool could expose databases, credentials, or backup data.

## How You Can Help

### 🐛 Found a Bug?

**Please report it!** Open an [issue](https://github.com/imisic/qmaster/issues) with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your setup (OS, Python version, WSL vs native Linux/macOS)
- Steps to reproduce
- Any error messages or logs

### 💡 Have a Feature Idea?

**Please suggest it!** Open an [issue](https://github.com/imisic/qmaster/issues) describing:
- The problem you're trying to solve
- How you envision it working
- Why it would be useful
- Any examples from other tools

### 🔒 Found a Security Issue?

**Please report it privately.** Don't open a public issue. Instead:
- Email the details (check my GitHub profile for contact)
- Or open an issue with minimal details asking me to contact you

### 📖 Documentation Improvements?

Typos, clarity improvements, or better examples in the README? Open an issue describing what's unclear or could be better.

## What About Forks?

If you're a developer and want to modify or improve the code for your own use:
- **Feel free to fork** - that's what open source is for
- Make it work better for your setup
- Share your improvements publicly if you want
- Just understand I won't be merging changes back

## Questions?

Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/imisic/qmaster/discussions) or an issue for:
- Help getting it working on your system
- Questions about how something works
- Suggestions for improvements

Since I'm not a developer, detailed explanations and examples are appreciated.
